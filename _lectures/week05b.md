## Start with Standup (aka "Daily Scrum")

By now, you should know the drill, but if not, you can click the triangle for more details:

<summary markdown="1">
Daily Standup details
</summary>
Make a post in your team slack channel answering the three standup questions:
* What have you finished since last standup?
* What are you working on now?
* Are you stuck on anything, or blocked by anything?

When you see that everyone that is present has made a post in the channel (including anyone attending remotely via zoom), 
invite everyone to stand, and read out their post to the group.

Take note of anyone that's missing; `@` them on the slack channel, and ask them to make a standup post as soon as they get an opportunity.

## Please work on team02

Please be sure that you review the Kanban board at least once a day (e.g. when it is posted to your team slack channel), and make sure that:
* you have at least one issue in the "in progress" column
* ideally, you have *exactly* one issue in the "in progress" column
* that you are helping your team to get code reviews merged.
