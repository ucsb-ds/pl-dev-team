## Today's work

* Preview of this week 
* Informed Consent Briefing
* Work on jpa03, jpa04

## First, these announcements

* Please try to finish up with jpa03 and jpa04 **as soon as you can**
* Neither involves any programming; just configuration, so they should go quickly
* That way, we're all prepared to start the first team activity *tomorrow*
* That one *will* involve some more signficant Java programming!

## There is a required team activity tomorrow and Thursday

* If you've been ahead, you may have gotten a little lazy about coming to class.
* Wednesday: We're dividing up tasks for team01, and setting up our team Kanban board
* Thursday: We're doing a deep dive into the Listening to Developer paper (group discussions)

So, please plan to be present and participate.

# Informed Consent Briefing

* You should have an invitation to a Qualtrics Survey in your email from Washington State University.
* It has two parts:
  * A consent form for participation in a research study
  * A survey about learning

You are required to fill it out, but you are *not* required to consent to particpating in the research.

There is a briefing that goes into more detail, and I hope you will give it your full attention for a few moments.

* I'll first deliver the required briefing (please follow along at: <page.informed_consent>) 
* Then I'll try to explain what we're doing and why
* Then I'll take any questions you have.

## After the briefing:

* Fill out the survey (this is Homework grade H02)
* Try to finish jpa03, jpa04; when you have, pair with teammates that are behind
* Be sure that you've completed H01 for Thursday.

Please leave only if/when you've completed H01, H02, jpa03, jpa04, and no-one else on your team needs help.
