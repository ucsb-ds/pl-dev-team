If you go under any PL question and click on the statistics tab, you'll see something like this:

As you can see, in this example, statistics are filled in for two of the assessments on which this question appears (E1 and E2), but are missing for many of the other assessments.  In your case, if you haven't worked with question statistics yet, you might find that *none* of the rows are filled in.

**Here's how you fix that**.

| Step | Screenshot |
|-|-|
| (1) The tag for each of the assesments shown in the first column is a clickable link.  Start by clicking the first one (in the example, that's IC11).|  <img width="474" height="259" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0e6e539-941c-4bf8-a15f-8adb25ec504b" /> |
| (2) After you click that link, find the tab that says `Question Stats` and click it. |  <img width="663" height="142" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c7ef6d8-f0b9-4504-84f4-d1004fa53576" />|
| (3) Click the button at upper right that says `Recalculate Statistics` |  <img width="766" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75dd8b4d-cc5a-40b0-bc84-8c98f4f3699e" /> |
| (4) Confirm by clicking `Submit` | <img width="625" height="152" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b623be9-6607-4025-a91d-447abf91505a" /> |
| (5) Return to the original question; you should see that statistics are now available for that question for that assessment.  Repeat this for each assessment for which you want to calculate question statistics | <img width="764" height="229" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b592ef5a-39e3-45e7-a622-804a2e950af2" /> |
