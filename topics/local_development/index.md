   docker login
   ```

3. **Clone your course repo**

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/YOUR-COURSE-REPO.git

## Common Error: Docker Daemon Not Running

If you see this error:

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/.../.docker/run/docker.sock
```

- Then retry the `docker run` command


## Note About External Graders

You may see:

```
Running PrairieLearn without support for external graders and workspaces.
```

This is fine for most local testing. To enable full support (e.g., for custom Docker grader images), follow:
