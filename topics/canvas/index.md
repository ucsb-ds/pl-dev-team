Eventually, UCSB's implementation of PrairieLearn will feature direct integration with Canvas.

In the meantime though, if you want grades from PrarieLearn into your Canvas gradebook, you need to use an indirect method 
involving these eight steps, which we'll describe first at a high-level, then in detail.

1. Create the assignment in Canvas
2. Export the Grades as a .csv file
3. Import that CSV file into a Google Sheets spreadsheet
4. Export the Grades from PrarieLearn as a .csv file 
5. Import that CSV file into the same Google Sheets spreadsheet.
6. Configure the column in the Canvas sheet in the spreadsheet to pull the grades from the other sheet using `VLOOKUP`
7. Export that sheet as a CSV
8. Import that final CSV into Canvas.



## 1. Create the assignment in Canvas

Create an assignment in Canvas.  Leave the dates blank, and make the submission type: `No submission`
